## Introduction
Here I want to share my thoughts about git features in a way that \(I hope\) 
people will understand git better.

## Core Concept & Rules
- Pretend that we're playing a game, where you can save your progress in a historical manner, where all your previous saves are being kept.
  - Even better, your previous save can be loaded and be played again
- You, and your team, can play the same game with the same cloud save -> 1 `git remote` used by multiple contributors
- 1 Person should create the first save data, and sync it to the cloud -> `git init`, `git commit`, `git push`
- Other person need to sync from the same cloud, then they can start play the game locally -> `git clone`
- Each time you create a commit by using `git commit`, you're actually saving your progress.
- You should sync your local saves to cloud save periodically to make sure your team aware of your progress -> `git push`
- you can see list of old save data (history) -> `git log`
  - In more detailed view, you can also see who made the history checkpoint, or even, who made the specific changes -> `git blame`
- You can time travel to old save data, and create a new branch of history (timeline) out of it -> `git branch`
- You can time travel to old save data, and overwrite the future saves -> `git push --force` 
  - ⚠️ Warning, this feature must not be used in co-op mode. If you insist to use it, 
make sure you have all contributor consent, and be cautious, once you break it and no one has the backup, 
it's game over, your previous history is permanently erased
- You can copy 1 cloud save into another cloud save -> [Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
- Every timeline / cloud save copy, can be combined into another timeline -> `merge`, `merge request`, `rebase`
- If needed, a timeline can choose to include "a specific good result" from another timeline -> `cherry pick`
- When you're already halfway of the game but don't get into a checkpoint, use "Save State", just like a game on certain retro emulators -> `git stash`
- After using "Save State", you will go back on the last checkpoint, but you can:
  - Check and fix another timeline first (`git branch`)
  - Load the "Save State" later -> `git unstash`
- You can rollback (`git revert`) a save data, this will invalidate the progress between a save data and previous history save data, but the history will remain
  - Let's say, you have history like this: A (+1 point = 1) -> B (+1 point = 2) -> C (+2 point = 4) -> D (+3 point = 7) 
  - you want to rollback C, since it's not perfect (not +3 point)
  - your new history: A (+1 point = 1) -> B (+1 point = 2) -> C (+2 point = 4) -> D (+3 point = 7) -> Revert C (-2 point = 5)
- When you try to combine (merge) timelines, there is a possibility of conflicts that should be resolved. 
reference: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line
  - let's say person A uses 10 point to increase AGI, meanwhile person B uses 10 point to increase VIT
  - in present save data, they have a total 10 point before being used
  - Person B want to merge the save data, but it shows error, and force person B to make a choice:
    1. Use mine (Person B) ⚠️ Warning, this option is dangerous
    2. Use theirs (Person A)
    3. Use both ⚠️ Better than 1st option, but in most cases it causes error if left alone
    4. Resolve conflict (combine both options)
  - In reality, many of first time git user will choose the 1st option, which will create a confusion between team members, since others' progression is gone
  - For best result, Person B should communicate with whoever made other changes, and create a solution acceptable by both parties.
