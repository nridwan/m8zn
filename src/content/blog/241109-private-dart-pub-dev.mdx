## 1. What is this?

This is another private Dart Package Repository, apart from existing solution, with its own unique approach.

Repository: https://github.com/nridwan/private-dart-pub-repo

## 2. Motivation

[Jetbrains Space is discontinued and will be shut down on Nov 30, 2024](https://blog.jetbrains.com/space/2024/05/27/the-future-of-space/).
This cause a huge concern since jetbrains space is the most promising affordable solution for private Dart Pcakage Repository at that time.
Although there is also other similar service, both paid and free, jebtrains space have advantages over plan flexibility, they even
have solution for on-premise host. Even though it's regrettable, their decision must be respected. Thanks for the good ride for a year.

## 3. Why

There are so many alternatives regarding this matter:
- Use free cloud private solution. Cons: We never know, how long will the service last, or how long until they made changes to the terms & conditions.
  - [OnePub](https://onepub.dev/)
- Subscribe premium solution. Cons: pricey, less availability for hobbyist
  - [Cloudsmith](https://help.cloudsmith.io/docs/dart-repository)
  - [Jfrog Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Pub+Repositories)
  - [Inedo Proget](https://docs.inedo.com/docs/proget/feeds/pub)
- [Use git-based package](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#git-packages). 
  Cons: versioning might be painful, if you have multiple package that have dependency hell to each other
- Copy paste entire repository as sub-package in monorepo project using [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/).
  Cons: once copied, it's project developer's responsibility to manually patch/merge update of the libraries.
- **DO IT YOURSELF**. yes, this is my choice, since I can design whatever I want with it.

## 4. Technology Used

- Golang (Fiber): The reason is quite shallow for this one, I want to deepen my understanding around golang while implement real world problem solution.
- PostgreSQL: Somehow structured database nowadays already cover basic needs of everything, including JSON datatype which can be considered semi-nosql trait.
- S3 compatible storage: to increase scalability of storage space attached to the server, 
  while also increasing security since not anyone can access the link (must be presigned).
- SMTP: for Forgot/change password feature, removing admin privilege of changing user's password.

## 5. Features
- User management:
  - Admin can create/update/delete users
  - User can see their profile after login
- Write access management:
  - Admin can disable/enable user's write access
  - User can create multiple pub token with different access level (read only/read-write)
- Package visibility:
  - Hosted package can be set as private/public by admin. 
  - When set to public, anyone without read token could also discover and use the package
  - When private, only user that already set the pub token can discover and use the package
- [Dart Repository Spec v2](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/repository-spec-v2.md) Implementation
  - could publish using `dart pub publish` to the server
  - could use hosted package using `dart pub add` or adding hosted package to `pubspec.yaml`

## 6. Showcase

### 6.1. Preparation step
1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/nridwan/private-dart-pub-repo
2. Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`, adjust environment & things. in this showcase, we will use port 3000 instead of 4000
3. run `docker compose up -d --build`. make sure no error
4. run `docker exec -it pubserver sh` to open docker shell of the server, then run `/pubserver db:seed` inside it
5. Open postman, import collection and environment provided in the `/docs` directory of repository

### 6.2. Token setup
1. Run `Users > Login` in the postman, make sure email/password the same as seeder.
2. Create token using `Pub Token > Create` in the postman, we will use write:true to enable read-write token.

3. Open terminal, run: `dart pub token add http://localhost:3000/v1/pub/` (on real host, `http://localhost:3000` should be changed to real url and https for safety)

### 6.3. Publishing
We will use [dartz](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz) as an example in this showcase
1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz)
2. Add publish_to section in `pubspec.yaml` with `http://localhost:3000/v1/pub/`:
![Add publish_to](/assets/241109/132124.png)
3. run `dart pub publish`:

![dart pub publish 2](/assets/241109/134536.png)

### 6.4. Using The Package
1. Create new dart/flutter project
2. Add the repository, there are multiple way to do it:
  - Add latest version using `dart pub add 'dartz:{"hosted":"http://localhost:3000/v1/pub/"}'`
  ![dart pub add latest](/assets/241109/134835.png)
  - Add specific version using `dart pub add 'dartz:{"hosted":"http://localhost:3000/v1/pub/","version":"^0.10.0"}'`
  ![dart pub add latest](/assets/241109/134835.png)
  - Directly add in pubspec.yaml then use `dart pub get`

3. Downloaded package can be used in the project like public dependency hosted at pub.dev
