## 1. What is this?

This tool is to generate generic `assetlinks.json` and `apple-app-site-association`
to add capabilities for Android and iOS app Universal Links.

You can use it here: https://assetlink.m8zn.work

### 2. Motivation

As we all know that 
[Firebase Dynamic Links is discontinued and will shut down on Aug 25th, 2025](https://firebase.google.com/support/dynamic-links-faq). 
At first, I'd like to create its clone, but after seeing the condition,
I think many people doesn't really need a cross product of shortlinking
and universal link handler, some of them need to connect a real website to
app when clicked. So, I decide to create this config generator instead,
and let them do anything to their website if accessible from device that
doesn't support or doesn't have the app installed.

- [app_links package on pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/app_links)
- [assetlinks.json setup guide](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks)

## 3. Future Plan

Currently the tool is very minimalist, you just go to the page,
insert your app, copy/download the generated file.

There are some improvement that's planned on my head (not sure when to continue):
- Autosave to local storage, which can be used to continue unfinished information
- Save/Load system, which will be able to save and share configuration to other people,
so those other people can load it back into the tool using different machine.
