## 1. About VPN

Most people will have ever heard about VPN, but really, what is VPN?
It's not just a simple service that redirects your internet connection.
Using analogy, it's more like an exclusive community where one should have a member card
to join, communicate, and even using the facilities, without worrying outside world could spy on them (encrypted).

In terms of most overused VPN as internet masking provider, the internet masking feature
is just merely a facility inside the network. It can be used for other things, for example:

- connecting multiple local device through internet, to share data or play games together
- accessing some server that's not publicly available on the internet
- publish local device server to the internet (tunneling)

## 2. Why Wireguard, what's different?

In terms of normal VPN, we know the term of "Server" and "Clients".

- Server: a device which serve as primary node where all client should connect to them,
  they manage what the client can do once they connect to it.
- Client: a device that connect to the server in attempt to do something.

Meanwhile in wireguard, both "Server" and "Clients" have equal standing, named "Peers".
Each Peers can connect to other peer, and can be connected from other peer.

The only note here is, not all "Peers" are created equals.

- As a server, peer should be configured to listen (using ListenPort) to a certain port,
  and a certain route configuration to enable the client to do something. and they also need
  to list their clients' public keys and IP addresses, each should be unique.
- As a client, peer should only need to specify their IP address, private key, server's public key,
  and what IP address to be forwarded to the server peer.
- As both client and server, should configure both.

Also, for IP configuration, it's well noted that wireguard doesn't follow the orthodox network
segments split by subnetmask/prefix. If you want to, you can have different IP segment, and even use /32 prefix for each IP.
For example: server is located at 192.168.255.1/32, and client is located at 10.0.0.1/32. it'll work, they can connect well.

## 3. Wireguard Scenario Example

### Sample Config

- Server (public IP: 1.2.3.4):

```conf
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = eBYIwdLD6GsXdcZvAJDow1N15TdEDpwZh8NkUoVplFM=

[Peer]
PublicKey = z09I2S7aEeAP12/F2z4wfJxZjG9nUd+//EkyO63cvEs=
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2

[Peer]
PublicKey = q5bTriMOm7KZeNWBR7RX1qhaDx9PlCa1SGyr/p2Ax0k=
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3

[Peer]
PublicKey = NtqA6CPnoeVBYza4xxf8pIzIY/3CvD+Ss1H7KRCFWgc=
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.4
```

In this setting, the server acknowledge there are 3 client that could connect to it, 10.0.0.2 ~ 10.0.0.4.
Once connected, they could access the server via 10.0.0.1. this server should also serve as gateway for
the clients if they want to connect somewhere else.

Each PublicKey should match with client's private key pair. and AllowedIPs should contain client's IP address.

In this configuration, each peer could only communicate with server, not with another client.
In order for client to connect to other client, there are 2 choices: add routing table, peer to peer direct connection

- Client:

```conf
[Interface]
PrivateKey = EPcFUviMlTTs1Th72TEQWtx6jzK62+/+kV551+0xvl4=
Address = 10.0.0.2/32

[Peer]
PublicKey = hW2VH25Q1wUCHEdyIc7/ht44urG+917d34nwsznSUyc=
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.1/32
Endpoint = 1.2.3.4:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

In this setting, the client (10.0.0.2) connect to server 1.2.3.4.
Client's private key will be matched with server PublicKey setting, if it's match, they're connected.

Since AllowedIPs is only 10.0.0.1/32, client can only access the server via 10.0.0.1.

Another example for AllowedIPs:

- full internet masking provider: `AllowedIPs: 0.0.0.0/0`
- can access certain other IP, using server as gateway: `AllowedIPs: 10.0.0.1/32, 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.5.32`
  - note: AllowedIPs support comma separated value, subnet prefix, and not using prefix (counted as /32 prefix)

Endpoint is how the client could connect to the server, where is server's public IP,
and which port act as Wireguard Server (ListenPort)

PersistentKeepalive is to make sure the client automatically initiate / retry connection per x seconds,
in this example 25 seconds.
This is optional, only needed when the server need to initiate connection to client,
since server only can access client after client do handshake/initiate connection,
and this configuration do it automatically.

### Peer to Peer

![Sample Config](/assets/250308/wg-peer-to-to-local.svg)

In this case, Client A add Client B as peer, and so does Client B. they'll communicate directly.
The weakness of this method is, if client A and client B is behind each of their own NAT (usually from internet provider)
this scenario can't be done

### Peer to Peer via Server Route Config

![Sample Config](/assets/250308/wg-peer-to-peer-to-local.svg)

In this case, Client A and Client B can be connected each other through Server,
only if the Server correctly setting their route config.

In the sample config above I use nftables syntax, which translated to:

```
When Client A want to contact Client B, accept it.
```

Normally, if this was other VPN method, they'd be assumed as same network and don't need routing.
Since this wireguard only provide host-to-peer connection, this configuration is needed to forward the network.

### Internet/Network Masking

![Sample Config](/assets/250308/wg-internet-to-local.svg)

This is the most simple and used by many people.
The server literally says: `I don't care, just pass through this way to anywhere`.

In more advanced scenario, we can limit which IPs need to pass through the VPN,
by limiting target IP in client's AllowedIPs.

### Internet to Local (tunnel)

![Sample Config](/assets/250308/wg-internet-to-local.svg)

This is quite unpopular method, but really powerful once we know its usage.
For this sample, it just says, redirect TCP connection to the server with port 8000 to Client A at port 7000.
So we will be able to connect Client A to the internet via wireguard.

I will cover the advanced usage of this method later, and spill why it's powerful,
even though we have tunneling service such as ngrok, cloudflare tunnel, etc.
