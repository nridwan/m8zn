Hello, as the first content, I'll share my experience on developing this site.

### Tech Stack Choices

- Need to create a small blog, that could be run on cloudflare pages, without maintaining any database. ✅ Astro, Svelte, React
- Want to try Svelte 5 RC ✅ Astro with Svelte Plugin, Svelte 5
- Need fast performance and can be indexed, also want to try SEO metadata > MPA ✅ Astro
- Need search feature ✅ Astro with (Pagefind.js)[https://pagefind.app/]
- Need syntax highlighter ✅ Astro built-in mdx parser with Prisma
- Easy styling, framework-agnostic css framework ✅ Tailwind + DaisyUI
- Trying bun on windows ✅ Bun

### Initial Research

- At first, I'm a bit skeptical about how astro can interact with those other stacks,
then found out that [Astro is compatible with Svelte 5](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/).
- Figure out about how to style the page in astro, and come across Astro templates.
There I found [Starlight Theme](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/) which already uses tailwind,
but seems too overkill for this experiment. But, there I find a piece of information about (Pagefind.js)[https://pagefind.app/]
- Searching through template list, I found [Frosti Template](https://frosti.saroprock.com/blog). 
Learning the repo structure, it's interesting that it is simple, and already use tailwind+DaisyUI.

### Development Phase

Here I try to combine the puzzle pieces from the information I've gathered in [Initial Research](#initial-research), with steps:
- Create new astro project from scratch
- Adding svelte, tailwind, mdx support for astro
- Changing svelte version to svelte 5 ⚠️ with notes, will explain later
- Develop layout & components both in Astro and Svelte, try to get the base idea from Frosti Template, 
and readjusting positioning & styling
- Add script to change theme ⚠️ with notes, will explain later
- Add Pagefind.js ⚠️ with notes, will explain later
- Add pagination & slug page with dummy contents
- Add tag pagination page
- Designing Blog List Item & Detail Page
- Add prismjs styling & copy button
- Finishing images & contents

### Technical Difficulties and how to solve it

#### Svelte 5 Experimental Support Issue

When using astro with svelte 5, there is an issue where svelte 5 slot, that's now using children props,
is not working properly when called in astro files, for example:

```astro
<SomeSvelteComponent>
  test text
</SomeSvelteComponent>
```

In example above, the `test text` won't be shown, because the slot is not functioning properly.

Then I found [this issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/10512). 
The issue starter also found the root cause and suggest fixes.

The fixes is tested by updating code in node_modules manually, and it works.

Since I need to get it done quickly, and nervous whether I could make a pull request or not, 
I decide to make a [working copy for this plugin](https://github.com/nridwan/astrojs-svelte5-patch)

#### Changing Theme

At first, I need to create a button which can read current theme, 
updating root data-theme and save to local storage when changing the theme.

It doesn't work, the initial script doesn't run, and even onclick event is not fired.
The reason is Astro by default only render the html content and leave out the script.

It's fixable by adding `client:load` from Astro file to other framework component 
that is called and needs to be able to run js. For example:
```astro
<ThemeIcon client:load />
```

Next, I want it to be conscious of changes (2 button and multiple tab must sync the state), 
that I need to use `storage` event that's fired every time localStorage value updated. 
there are 2 fatal flaw when implementing this.

First, rule of thumb, when listening at something when component initialized (onMount/initState/other similar function) 
on a declarative UI approach, do not forget to unlisten it once the component is removed (onDestroy/dispose/other similar function). 
But, this time, the compiler got error when using onDestroy function. the reason is, onDestroy called server side.

To make the component's script doesn't get loaded on server side, need to add client:only directive.
example:
```astro
<ThemeIcon client:load client:only="svelte" />
```

Second, the listener doesn't get executed when localStorage changed. It's because storage event will only fire on another tab.
To make it fire on own tab, create custom storage event right after localStorage updated.
```astro
window.dispatchEvent(
  new StorageEvent("storage", {
    storageArea: localStorage,
    key: "theme",
    oldValue: oldTheme,
    newValue: theme,
  })
);
```

Last, the loading process from localStorage to be applied when page load, is taking several frame before it's applied.
After researching, it's because of the script will only run when page is fully loaded. To be honest, 
this was annoying for my eyes, since it's too flashy. Searching in starlight repo, since their theme changing script
is flawless, I found that you can use script in astro files and mark it as `is:inline` 
to make it load as soon as script is parsed while pausing render process. so, to load the theme once after reload,
here's the script:
```astro
<script is:inline>
  const storedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
  if (storedTheme) {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", storedTheme);
  }
</script>
```

#### Pagefind.js can't test at dev

At first, I refer to [this article](https://minifloppy.it/posts/2024/adding-pagefind-search-astro-website/#creating-the-search-page) 
to implement Pagefind.js. but after trying, it works on build preview, but I can't test it on dev environment.

Search for solution, I find [this article](https://scottwillsey.com/astro-pagefind/) suggesting 
[Sergey Shishkin's Astro-Pagefind](https://github.com/shishkin/astro-pagefind). 
There I give it a try. The implementation is more straightforward, and it will use last build indexing when on dev mode

#### Bun can't add tailwind

Bun have 2 mode, run using nodejs, or run using bun.exe when using flag `--bun`.
To get the most of bun, I always try to use that flag, but got error when running `bunx --bun astro add tailwind`.

Since this is [known issue](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/6843)

The only thing that I can do right now is to avoid using `--bun` flag for a while.

#### Bun can't install from git
when I try to execute `bun add git+https://github.com/nridwan/astrojs-svelte5-patch.git#tags/v5.4.0`
it got error:
```
error: moving "git+https://github.com/nridwan/astrojs-svelte5-patch.git#tags/v5.4.0" to cache dir failed
ENOTEMPTY: Directory not empty (NtSetInformationFile())
```

to avoid it, I try to add the dependency manually to package.json then install it using `bun install`:
```json
//package.json
{
//...
"dependencies": {
  //...
  "@astrojs/svelte": "git+https://github.com/nridwan/astrojs-svelte5-patch.git#tags/v5.4.0",
  //...
}
//...
}
```

#### Bun cannot deploy to cloudflare pages
got error:
```
03:09:23.556	error: lockfile had changes, but lockfile is frozen
03:09:23.561	Error: Exit with error code: 1
03:09:23.561	    at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/snapshot/dist/run-build.js)

03:09:23.568	Failed: build command exited with code: 1
03:09:24.478	Failed: error occurred while running build command
```

For temporary will use pnpm instead

### Final Thoughts
Using bleeding edge technology sure is fun, as long as we know the how to deal with the limitation,
and lower the expectation about everyhing is stable and bug free.
