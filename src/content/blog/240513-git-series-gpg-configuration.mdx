## Why?

At [previous content](/blog/240512-1-git-series-multiple-credential-git-config)
we have discussed about how to commit as another Name/Email address in a single device.
This raise a security concern (though some of you will realize after I state this),
as it is so easy for you to become an impostor (impersonate someone) in git ecosystem.

For example, in a company, someone could hide their responsibility by changing their git settings
to use other person's email and name. Or in public repositories with many contributors,
one can become an impostor with having same name, similar username, different email,
but make a pull request trying to fool everyone to see it as the real person making the request,
and the commit is using the real person email.

It is partially my consequences of revealing this technique, but since there is this countermeasure,
I'm sure this method is quite well known out there.
To counter this, we will try to learn GPG key.

## Glossary

Hold on, usually glossary found as a footnote, why here though?

> Because you need to know where to set it up and what we will learn

Directories:

- Home Directory: `<HOME_DIRECTORY>`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\yourname\`
  - Linux/Mac: `/home/yourname`

Files:

- Main Git Config File: `<HOME_DIRECTORY>/.gitconfig`

### What is GPG Key

https://www.gnupg.org/
TL;DR: GPG keys provide a digital identity for encryption and signing. But in git case, we'll only talk about signing features.

Think of it like this:

- You're sending a package to someone, imagine GPG key is a seal, or a stamp.
- This stamp, will react to a special ultraviolet lamp, that you share to your recipients.
- Other ultraviolet lamp won't be able to react to this stamp.
- You will stamp your package.
- The recipient will validate your stamp.

The analogy:
Stamp -> private key
Special Ultraviolet Lamp -> public key

In git case, github/gitlab/git remote providers are the recipient, they will validate your commits, and you are the package sender.

## Setup Guide

### GPG Installation

- Normal Mode: You can use official distribution https://gnupg.org/download/
- Easy Mode: use your favorite OS package manager.
  - https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/gnupg/
  - https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=gpg&id=52bd1fd0d81eca16e57b7d328c5a032b7f795215
  - https://winget.run/pkg/GnuPG/GnuPG
  - https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gnupg
  - https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnupg

Whatever decision you make, as long as `gpg` command installed, you are fine

Get the path to GPG command with this:

- linux/mac: `which gpg`
- windows (Powershell): `(Get-Command gpg).Path`

for example, mine is:
`C:\Users\myusername\scoop\apps\gpg\current\bin\gpg.exe`

Take note for this, we will come back later

### Create and Setup GPG Key on Remote Providers

- Create key by using command `gpg --full-generate-key`
  - For me personally, I use:
    - kind of key -> default -> ECC (Sign and encrypt)
    - which elliptic curve -> Curve 25519
    - key don't expire
  - Note, my personal choice is not a must, seems github can accept most of these choices
  - Then input:
    - input your name
    - your registered git remote account's email, in this example I'll use `admin@m8zn.work`
    - your GPG password, will be asked each time you make a commit (cached 30 mins each time success inputting password)
- run command `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format-long`, it'll show kinda like this:

```
sec   ed25519/451DF2575F5A9588 2024-05-12 [SC]
      D4DBCE468C79D17E198A993F451DF2575F5A9588
uid                 [ultimate] Mietzen <admin@m8zn.work>
ssb   cv25519/D0B5878A53044D28 2024-05-12 [E]
```

- see this part: ed25519/\<ID\>, note down this ID
- run command `gpg --armor --export <ID>`, in this example: `gpg --armor --export 451DF2575F5A9588`, it'll show:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

blablablablablablablablabla
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

- go to GPG keys setting on your provider, usually on settings/preference, here's some sample:
  - github: https://github.com/settings/keys
  - gitlab: https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/gpg_keys
- press `new GPG key` (or `add new key` in gitlab) button
- you will be presented with textarea, paste the exported public key in previous steps
  - copy and include from `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` part until `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`
- you will see your newly added key, see the email address.
  - if there is no "Unverified" text, you're good to go
  - if there is "Unverified" text,
    it means the email you use to create key is different from your account's email,
    repeat step from create key

### Enable GPG Signing in Git

- open `<HOME_DIRECTORY>/.gitconfig`
- if you follow my previous guide or your device is able to commit a thing,
  there must be a `[user]` section there. add `signingkey = <ID>` to the user section. Using previous section example,
  the updated gitconfig would be like this:

```.gitconfig
[user]
	name = Your Name
	email = yourmainaccount@gmail.com
  signingkey = 451DF2575F5A9588
```

- add `gpgsign = true` to `[commit]` section, if there is no `[commit]` section, add it:

```.gitconfig
[commit]
	gpgsign = true
```

- add `program = <PATH_TO_GPG_COMMAND>` to `[gpg]` section, if there is no `[gpg]` section, add it.
  - use the path we find when [GPG Installation](#gpg-installation)
  - backslash become double backslash for windows
  - slash still the same in linux/mac

```.gitconfig
[gpg]
	program = C:\\Users\\myusername\\scoop\\apps\\gpg\\current\\bin\\gpg.exe
```

- Setup done, save the file, we will try to validate it
- Open any git repo, make change, try to commit
  - if you're prompted a password, and commit success afterwards, it's success.
  - if not prompted a password, check `signingkey` setup in gitconfig, possibly wrong section or not yet exist
  - if got error "no secret key", `signingkey` is different from your keys existed in `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long`
  - if password failed, check your memory once more, the password is GPG password, not your git password
- use `git log --show-signature` to double check, quit the interface by pressing `q` in keyboard.
  - if there is `Signature made`, `Good signature`. congratulations, it's success.
- Final check (optional), `push` your commit. check your github/gitlab/other provider site. check your repository's commit.
  your commit should have "verified" text in it.

~~Great, now you can flex your verified checkmark~~

### Bonus, Multi Account Signing

If you follow my [previous content](/blog/240512-1-git-series-multiple-credential-git-config),
you already know you can have separate email/name for specific directories.
Now, you can also have "separate" GPG keys setup for each directories.

Just setup new GPG keys for your second account, then at your specific directory `.gitconfig`, add `signingkey`,
similar with steps in section [Enable GPG Signing in Git](#enable-gpg-signing-in-git)
