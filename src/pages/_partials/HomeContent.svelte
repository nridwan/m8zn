      Hello, Welcome to my atelier. I'm a knowledge-devouring creature, whose
      main quest is to devour all software development stuff. I believe that
      knowledge itself is infinite, and thus it'll be a neverending journey for
      me.
      <br />
      As a side quest, I also play games, such as Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai Star
      Rail, Genshin Impact, and Granblue Fantasy. When consumed in the correct amount,
      they will increase my motivation to continue my main quest.

      From here onwards, I'll do some experiments and share the results at the
      blog section. Also, I'll post my existing knowledge, as opinionated tips &
      recommendations around software development stuff. This will also help me
      remember the journey I've done, maybe sometime in the future I'll have a
      hard time remembering it. Hope this will help people who come across this
      site to scroll and read.

      At the moment, I'm mostly proficient in mobile development-related stuff,
      especially Android stuff, then web development in second place. I'd like
      to balance my knowledge later, and hope game development would be my top
      three.

      Note for myself: If you ever lost your way and remember this site
      accidentally, remember, you have did your best, and continue moving
      forward.
